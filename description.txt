MICRO-MACRO MULTISECTORAL MODEL - HOUSEHOLDS DISAGGREGATION (ver. 4.0)

*********************************************************************************************************************************************

This is the household-disaggregated version of the Finance-Augmented MMM model, created by Vianna (2021) which itself an expansion of Dweck (2006) and used in Dweck, Vianna and Barbosa (2018). 
Coded by Emmanuel Tsallis (advised by Italo Pedrosa and Matheus Vianna).

ORIGIN:

The origin of the MMM model can be traced back to Mario Possas's Ph.D. Thesis (Possas 1983). In order to explain the main components of the dynamics of a capitalist economy, Possas combines theoretical propositions of three of the most influential economists of the twentieth century: John Maynard Keynes, Michail Kalecki and Joseph Schumpeter. 
Possas stablishes a multisectoral model where basic units are the sectors and intersectoral relationships give birth to dynamics, not only sectoral but also aggregated. The model was based on input-output matrices to determine sectoral conponents of the intermediate consumption of each sector. 
As highligthed by the author, the model was already very complex and it would require a solution by computer simulation. However, due to the inexistent computation and processing power at that time, he opted for analytical solution. Only at the end of 90's the author started to work again in the model, now with enough computational power to use numeric solution. 
Possas and Dweck (2004) presented the consolidated MMM model for the first time while Dweck (2006) did an extensive analysis of the dynamic properties.


MODEL DESCRIPTION AND FEATURES:

The MMM model is a multisectoral micro-macro dynamic model of simulation, that combines theorectical foundations from pos-keynesian, kaleckian and schumpeterian
approaches, useful to investigate general dynamic properties of capitalist economies.

Multisectoral: most of the general dynamic properties derives from the intersectoral relationships, using input-output matrices to determine intersectoral demands. Additionally, a matrix of income apropriation determines income distribution among different households from functional distribution. Sectors basically differ by how they fit in the productive chain, which can be capital goods production, intermediate goods production or consumption goods production. Sectoral demands are determined endogenously by firms and household decisions.
	The core version runs with the minimum number of sector of each type (1), but the model can be generalized for more than one sector of each type, employing input-output matrices to generate sectoral demands, as proposed by Possas (1983). The number of households is determined by the modeler and can be adjusted for different levels of disaggregation.  
	Additionally, the model have two "exoneous" blocks that were simplified in the core version: Government and External Sector.

1. Dynamic:

The model generates dynamic trajectories in discrete time steps. It is a disequilibrium model?no equilibrium condition is imposed at any point. The basic time unit corresponds to a production period for firms, which can be understood as one quarter in chronological time.?During each time step:

	1.1. Individuals (Households) make consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions based on their incomes and expectations.

	1.2. Firms plan and carry out production?using their capacity, labor, and intermediate inputs?and may also adjust other strategies (e.g., investment, markups) according to preset frequencies or triggers.

Some decisions (e.g., investment in new capital, markup adjustments) may occur less frequently than the production itself, capturing the real-world lag between planning and implementation. The model thus remains inherently disequilibrium-based, with no requirement that supply and demand balance exactly in any market each period.

2. Micro-Macro:

Decisions occur at both the household and firm levels, reflecting the microeconomic behaviors of these agents. The outcomes of these decisions aggregate to influence sectoral and macroeconomic dynamics. Similarly, the sectoral and macro structures provide feedback mechanisms that influence the decisions of households and firms, ensuring a dynamic interaction between micro and macro levels.

3. Theoretical:

The main goal of the model is to investigate the general dynamic properties of capitalist economies, so the results are general, theoretical, representing only the essential elements of a non-specific capitalist economy. Historical, national, and institutional particularities are, most of the time, omitted from the model.

4. Agent-Based: 

Households and firms are the main agents. Households represent individual economic units, making decisions about consumption, savings, and labor supply based on their incomes, preferences, and expectations. Firms, belonging to distinct sectors, drive structural changes endogenously, influenced by technological and strategic diversity. These agents interact dynamically, with decisions at the micro-level shaping sectoral and macroeconomic outcomes. Key decisions include:

(i) production, prices, and profits: Firms base production decisions on expected sales for the production period, extrapolated from averages of past periods. Prices follow an oligopoly structure with elements of price competition and product differentiation, employing a modified Kalecki price model (1954, ch. 1). Actual prices reflect a weighted average of expected markups and market averages, adjusted by competitive performance feedback.

(ii) investment: Firms decide on new capacity investments using extrapolated sales expectations from prior periods, constrained by debt following Kalecki's principle of increasing risk (1954, ch. 8). Financial factors, including debt/equity ratio and liquidity demand, influence these decisions.

(iii) technological search: Firms combine stochastic innovative and imitative search processes (Nelson and Winter, 1982) with learning mechanisms inspired by the vintage model of Silverberg et al. (1988). Decisions on equipment replacement incorporate a payback period criterion, enhancing technological evolution.


TIMELINE OF EVENTS:

1. Income Realization (Individuals)
Individuals receive their incomes from the previous period: wages from firms (or government), distributed profits if they hold shares, and any other transfers (e.g., social benefits).

2. Individual Decisions
Consumption and Saving: Each individual decides how much to consume and how much to save, typically based on their disposable income, wealth, and expectations.
Labor Supply: Individuals decide whether (and how much) to supply labor to firms, subject to firm demand for labor.

3. Planned Production (Firms)
First Firm Decision: Firms in each sector plan production based on expected sales.
Consumption & Intermediate Goods: Expected sales derive from the aggregate individual consumption demand for the consumption sector, plus firm demand for intermediates.
Capital Goods: Production depends on the effective orders from other firms? investment needs (and exports).

4. Effective Production (Firms)

Firms produce according to their planned production, but actual output is constrained by:
	- Capacity (installed capital)
	- Availability of intermediate inputs
	- Labor hired
Production typically follows a Leontief technology combining labor, capital, and inputs.

5. Price Decision (Firms)
Second Firm Decision: Firms set prices as a weighted average of (i) their desired price (markup over variable costs) and (ii) the average market price in the sector.
Firms may adjust desired markups based on competitiveness or profitability targets.

6. External Sector
Exports for each sector are determined by an exogenous or semi-endogenous rule (e.g., a fixed coefficient times foreign income, plus price competitiveness).

7. Total Sectoral Orders
(i) Consumption Goods: Summed individual consumption demand (from Step 2) plus export demand.
(ii) Capital Goods: Demand driven by firms? investment orders (see Step 10) plus exports.
(iii) Intermediate Goods: Third Firm Decision in user sectors?firms place orders for next period?s production requirements.

8. Firm?s Orders & Market Share
A firm?s effective orders depend on the total sectoral demand (from Step 7) and on its market share, which evolves according to a replicator dynamic or similar mechanism (affected by competitiveness, price, quality, and delivery times).

9. Sales
Actual sales result from fulfilling the orders received (Step 8).
If the firm cannot meet demand (due to capacity, input constraints, or labor supply limitations), unmet orders become backlogs or delivery delays, negatively impacting future competitiveness.

10. Income Creation
(i) Functional Distribution:
	- Total Wages: Sum of wages paid by all firms and government to individuals (including R&D wages, if relevant).
	- Total Profits: Sector-level revenues minus variable costs (wages, inputs, indirect taxes, and R&D expenses). A portion of these profits may be distributed to individual shareholders.
(ii) Personal (Individual) Distribution:
	- Each household receives wage income (if employed) plus any distributed profits or interest.
	- Individual household income and consumption patterns are tracked separately, allowing for detailed analysis of income distribution and consumption behavior.

11.Investment Decision (Firms)
Fourth Firm Decision: At the end of the investment cycle, each firm decides if and how much to invest, subject to financial constraints.
(i) Capacity Expansion: Based on expected future sales and desired capacity utilization.
(ii) Replacement: To offset physical depreciation.
(iii) Obsolescence: Replacement or expansion triggered by new technologies and payback criteria.

12. R&D (Firms)
Firms allocate resources to innovation and diffusion (imitative) activities, following approaches like Nelson & Winter (1982).
Technological progress affects future productivity and cost structures.

13. Entry and Exit (Firms)
Firms may exit if they have persistently low market share or high debt (financial distress).
New firms may enter only if there is an ?open slot? due to exit, or if specific entry conditions are met (e.g., policy promoting new entrants).

MODEL CALIBRATION AND INITIALIZATION

This version includes an automatic initialization and calibration procedures. Users do not need to define all parameters and lagged values manually since most of them are calculated and writen by the model itself at the first time period based only on a subset of parameters and some hypothesis (homogeneity among firms and stock-flow consistency norms).
Most of the parameters that contains the word "initial" on their names are used only for this procedure.
Additionally, multiple instances of objects are created in this proceadure. The initial number of objects are parameters controlled by the user.

Hypothesis:
1. Firms: All firms start homogeneously within each sector. Heterogeneity among firms will develop dynamically during the simulation.
2. Agents: All agents (households) start with an initial income, savings, and labor supply distribution based on user-defined or empirical data. Heterogeneity is introduced during simulation via income realization and individual decisions.
3. Economy: The economy begins in a non-growth steady-state position, with growth and cycles generated endogenously during the simulation.
4. Stock-Flow Consistency: All initial stock-flow ratios are constant, ensuring coherence between stocks (e.g., capital, savings) and flows (e.g., income, production).
5. Investment: There is no initial expansion or replacement investment; initial investments only offset physical depreciation of capital goods.

To better understand that procedure, see variable "Initialization_2".
